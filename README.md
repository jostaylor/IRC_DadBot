# IRC_DadBot

Connect to your favorite IRC server and watch as DadBot works his fatherly magic!
Things DadBot tends to do:
- Give you general server information
- Tell you what you time it is
- Leave the server respectfully
- Tell you how much he loves his kids
- Additionally dad bot will look for any 'im' in the chat and reply with, "hi ______, I'm dad hahaha". So if you were to say, "I'm hungry", dadbot would reply, "hi hungry, I'm dad. Hahaha!"
